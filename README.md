# Installation

## Windows
Download the "Windows.zip" from the Releases section, unzip and run "Web.PDF.saver.v0.5.exe". It takes a while to start.

[Note: The binaries(exe files) are not compiled by me. If you want to be super secure then run the source code by the below methods]

OR

Install python and then pip install numpy matplotlib.pyplot fpdf pyautogui. Then, download and run the script

## Linux
Install python and then pip install numpy matplotlib.pyplot fpdf pyauto. Then, download and run the script

## Web PDF saver
Alpha 0.5: Doesn't save PDFs as of yet. Feel free to submit a pull request
